A side channel is an attack on the implementation of the algorithm. You make an hypothesis. Then you do the algorithm and check which hypothesis matches the most and that is your guess. Your hypothesis could be all possible keys, and you try this for every hypothesis. You can probably improve your hypothesis every time based on the result .  

The correct value of the weight w will result in a higher correlation standing out from all other wrong hypotheses given enough measurements. Remember, if you have 8 or 16 bit registers there are actually not that many hypothesis !

You can use these to do [[Model Stealing]].
