GANs adversarial machine learning. You have two models and pit them against each other to make them both improve. The loss function of the model is related to the prediction of the other model. 

- Generator: generating fake images from the noise. Tries to fool discriminator.
- Discriminator: trying to distinguish real and fake images.

After you have these models you have a model which can detect fake images and a model which can generate images. Both very useful.

## Applications of GANs

- Generating synthetic data.
	- For privacy reasons or lack of data.
- Improving image quality.
	- Old images or astronomical images.
- Generating images for fashion and art.
