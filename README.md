These are notes I made for the privacy & security of machine learning course I did. I found it very intresting. The course code was NWI-IMC069. 

The notes where made in [obsidian](https://obsidian.md). I also recomend you use this software to view the notes. 

At some point during studying I transitioned to making paper notes so these notes are a bit less flashed out than my other notes and summary repos. But still nice none the less.
